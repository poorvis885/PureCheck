# Multi Sensor Adulteration Detection System

## Overview
The **Milk & Food Adulteration Detection System** is an advanced AI and IoT-based solution designed to detect adulterants in milk, fruits, and vegetables using state-of-the-art sensors and machine learning techniques. This system ensures food safety by providing **rapid, accurate, and user-friendly** adulteration detection.

## Features
- **Multi-Adulterant Detection**: Identifies contaminants in milk, fruits, and vegetables.
- **Advanced Sensor Technology**: Utilizes pH, TDS, and turbidity sensors for precise analysis.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Machine learning models detect and classify adulterants.
- **Compact & Portable**: Designed for convenient use by consumers, dairy farms, and the food industry.
- **Real-time Results**: Provides instantaneous adulteration reports with visual indicators.
- **IoT-Enabled**: Allows remote data access through a web application.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies result interpretation for users.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware Components**: Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi 4, pH Sensor, TDS Sensor, Turbidity Sensor.
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++ (Embedded).
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Cloud & IoT**: Firebase/MQTT for remote data monitoring.
- **Database**: MySQL/MongoDB for test result storage.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React optional).
